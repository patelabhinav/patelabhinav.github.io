## Self Initiated Projects
- **Content prevention**:- To prevent the unauthorized sharing of resources, I developed an application that tracks the resources in most popular social networking applications.
- Have published **blogs** on concepts related to DataWeave for sharing knowledge 
- **Lightweight Infrastructure as Service** (LWIS) Container Pulse Mapping using Golang: - The requirement was to develop a lightweight application to keep track health of the containers in cases where services were deployed on multiple containers and for an application to work all the services need to be working. 
- **Microservice development using swagger**: - Demonstrated concept of “API led connectivity” and “Spec driven development” through automated development of a flask application from the swagger file on a click. The application was then hosted on GCP and a security layer was later added using Apigee. Further implemented Docker to demonstrate the true potential of Microservice Architecture. 
- **Automatic Evaluation of MuleSoft and Apigee**: - Part of the internal training process need participants to be evaluated through project-oriented assessments. Our team developed the automated evaluation tool for MuleSoft and Apigee to smoothen this process
