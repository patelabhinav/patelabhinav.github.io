- Lightweight Infrastructure as Service (LWIS) Container Pulse Mapping using Golang: - The requirement was to develop a lightweight application to keep track health of the containers in cases where services were deployed on multiple containers and for an application to work all the services need to be working. 
- Microservice development using swagger: - Demonstrated concept of ‚ÄúAPI led connectivity‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpec driven development‚Äù through automated development of a flask application from the swagger file on a click. The application was then hosted on GCP and a security layer was later added using Apigee. Further implemented Docker to demonstrate the true potential of Microservice Architecture.
